## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

# Problem Statement

In the current situation there're:

- More than 156 litres of water is used in a single household.
- An increase in population growth yet the water amount is same.
- An increase in emission of greenhouse gas due to increase in energy usage for pumping and supply of the water.

# Solution

- By use of IoT devices we created a Me-prototype which is used to monitor consumption and leakages.
- Through this we are able to inform the consumer to minimize on water usage which coherently lead to less energy being used.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
